#Objective:
The objective of this code is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a common and potentially life-threatening respiratory infection, and early detection is crucial for timely treatment and patient care. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more effectively and efficiently.

Abstract:
This code utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks, specifically TensorFlow and Keras, to construct a CNN architecture tailored for pneumonia detection. The process begins with comprehensive data preprocessing steps, including loading and resizing the chest X-ray images to a standardized size, converting them to grayscale to reduce computational complexity, and normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1]. Furthermore, to enhance the model's generalization capability and robustness, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, and flipping are applied to the training dataset.

The CNN architecture comprises multiple convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, to extract hierarchical features from the input images. Max-pooling layers are interspersed to downsample the feature maps and reduce spatial dimensions. Dropout regularization layers are incorporated to mitigate overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of neurons during training. The final layers consist of densely connected units with sigmoid activation to produce binary predictions indicating the presence or absence of pneumonia.

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and optimized using the binary cross-entropy loss function, which is well-suited for binary classification tasks. Training progresses over multiple epochs, with batched samples from the training dataset being fed into the network iteratively. The model's performance is monitored using validation data to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization to unseen data.

Upon completion of training, the model is evaluated on an independent test dataset to assess its performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The trained model is then saved in a portable format for future use and deployment in real-world scenarios.

Finally, the trained model is applied to new, unseen chest X-ray images to predict whether pneumonia is present. The predictions are visualized alongside the original images, facilitating interpretation and decision-making by healthcare professionals.
